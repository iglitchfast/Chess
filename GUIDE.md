# Chess Game - Interactive Guide

---

## üìö Overview

### Project Architecture

This chess game is built with three core modules:

**‚Ä¢ ChessMain.py - User Interface & Game Loop**
  Handles rendering, user input, animations, themes, and all visual elements using Pygame

**‚Ä¢ ChessEngine.py - Game Logic & Rules**
  Manages board state, move validation, special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)

**‚Ä¢ ChessAI.py - Artificial Intelligence**
  Implements minimax with alpha-beta pruning, evaluation functions, and move ordering

### Technology Stack

‚Ä¢ Python 3.x - Core programming language
‚Ä¢ Pygame - Graphics and game framework
‚Ä¢ Algorithm: Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax
‚Ä¢ Data Structures: 2D arrays, hash tables
‚Ä¢ Design Pattern: Model-View separation

## ‚ôü Chess Pieces

### Pawn (p) - Value: 1

**Movement:** Forward one square (two on first move)
**Capture:** Diagonally forward
**Special:** En passant, Promotion to Q/R/B/N

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Pawn structure controls space
‚Ä¢ Advanced pawns (passed pawns) are powerful
‚Ä¢ Doubled/isolated pawns are weaknesses

**AI Considerations:**
‚Ä¢ Center pawns worth more (position tables)
‚Ä¢ Advanced pawns get bonus evaluation
‚Ä¢ Pawn promotion prioritized in move ordering

### Knight (N) - Value: 3.2

**Movement:** L-shape (2+1 squares)
**Unique:** Only piece that can jump over others

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Most effective in closed positions
‚Ä¢ Controls up to 8 squares from center
‚Ä¢ Knights on rim are dim (edge penalties)

**AI Evaluation:**
‚Ä¢ Strong central knights (+1.5 to +2 bonus)
‚Ä¢ Edge/corner knights penalized (-5 to -3)
‚Ä¢ Rewarded for development (not on back rank)

### Bishop (B) - Value: 3.3

**Movement:** Any number of squares diagonally
**Constraint:** Stays on same color squares

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Powerful in open positions
‚Ä¢ Bishop pair is strong (controls all squares)
‚Ä¢ Long diagonal bishops are dangerous

**AI Evaluation:**
‚Ä¢ Central positions highly valued (+1 bonus)
‚Ä¢ Diagonal control rewarded
‚Ä¢ Slightly more valuable than knight

### Rook (R) - Value: 5

**Movement:** Any number of squares horizontally/vertically
**Special:** Participates in castling

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Dominates open files and ranks
‚Ä¢ Connected rooks (7th rank) are powerful
‚Ä¢ Best in endgame positions

**AI Evaluation:**
‚Ä¢ Prefers 7th/2nd ranks (+0.5 to +1)
‚Ä¢ Open file control rewarded
‚Ä¢ Castling rights affect king safety score

### Queen (Q) - Value: 9

**Movement:** Combines Rook + Bishop
**Most powerful piece on the board**

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Can control up to 27 squares
‚Ä¢ Early queen moves often risky
‚Ä¢ Devastating in open positions

**AI Evaluation:**
‚Ä¢ Central position slightly preferred
‚Ä¢ Heavy penalty if lost (9 points)
‚Ä¢ Queen trades only when ahead

### King (K) - Value: ‚àû

**Movement:** One square in any direction
**Special:** Castling (kingside/queenside)
**Objective:** Protect at all costs!

**Strategic Value:**
‚Ä¢ Middlegame: Stay safe, castle early
‚Ä¢ Endgame: Become active, centralize

**AI Evaluation:**
‚Ä¢ Middlegame: Prefers back rank safety
‚Ä¢ Endgame: Central king (+4 bonus)
‚Ä¢ King safety function counts shield pieces
‚Ä¢ Exposed king heavily penalized

## ü§ñ AI Algorithm

### Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

**Core Concept:**
The AI searches through possible future positions to find the best move. It assumes both players play optimally.

**How it works:**
1. Generate all possible moves
2. For each move, simulate opponent's responses
3. Evaluate positions at search depth
4. Choose move leading to best evaluation

**Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
Optimization that skips branches that can't affect the final decision, reducing computation by up to 75%!

**Depth Levels:**
‚Ä¢ Easy (1): Looks 1 move ahead
‚Ä¢ Medium (2): Looks 2 moves ahead (1 full turn)
‚Ä¢ Hard (3): Looks 3 moves ahead
‚Ä¢ Expert (4): Looks 4 moves ahead (2 full turns)

### Evaluation Function

The AI scores positions using multiple factors:

**Material (70% weight):**
  Sum of piece values on board

**Position Tables (10% weight):**
  Rewards pieces on strong squares
  Example: Central knights > edge knights

**King Safety (50% weight):**
  Counts friendly pieces near king
  Penalties for exposed king

**Mobility (5% weight):**
  Number of legal moves available
  More moves = more options

**Center Control (30% weight):**
  Occupying central squares (d4,e4,d5,e5)

**Pawn Structure (20% weight):**
  Penalties: doubled, isolated pawns
  Bonuses: passed pawns

**Piece Activity (10% weight):**
  Developed pieces, advanced pawns

### Move Ordering Optimization

The AI examines promising moves first to enable better pruning. Move priority:

1. **Captures** (especially valuable pieces)
   Score: 10 √ó (captured) - (attacker)

2. **Pawn Promotions**
   Score: +8

3. **Castling**
   Score: +2

4. **Center Control**
   Score: +0.5

This ordering can reduce search time by 3-5x!

### Transposition Table

A hash table that remembers evaluated positions to avoid recalculating them.

**How it works:**
‚Ä¢ Each board position gets a unique hash
‚Ä¢ Hash = board state + whose turn
‚Ä¢ Stores: position score + search depth
‚Ä¢ Retrieves score if depth >= current depth

**Benefits:**
‚Ä¢ Speeds up searches by ~40%
‚Ä¢ Handles transpositions (same position reached via different move orders)
‚Ä¢ Memory efficient (clears each search)

## üéØ Tips & Strategy

### Opening Principles

**1. Control the Center**
   Move e4, d4, Nf3, Nc3 early
   Center pawns and pieces are powerful

**2. Develop Pieces Quickly**
   Get knights and bishops out
   Don't move the same piece twice

**3. Castle Early**
   Protects your king
   Connects your rooks

**4. Don't Bring Queen Out Too Early**
   Enemy pieces can attack it
   You'll waste time retreating

**5. Connect Your Rooks**
   Clear pieces between them
   They support each other

### Tactical Patterns

**Fork:**
  One piece attacks two+ enemy pieces
  Knights are excellent forkers

**Pin:**
  Attack piece that shields valuable piece
  Pinned piece can't/shouldn't move

**Skewer:**
  Attack valuable piece, revealing another
  Opposite of pin (valuable piece in front)

**Discovered Attack:**
  Moving one piece reveals another's attack
  Very powerful if unexpected

**Double Check:**
  Two pieces give check simultaneously
  King MUST move (can't block/capture)

**Back Rank Mate:**
  Checkmate on 8th/1st rank
  King trapped by own pawns

### Beating the AI

**On Easy/Medium:**
  ‚Ä¢ Control center aggressively
  ‚Ä¢ Develop pieces fast
  ‚Ä¢ Look for tactical shots (forks, pins)

**On Hard:**
  ‚Ä¢ Play solid, avoid blunders
  ‚Ä¢ Build strong pawn structure
  ‚Ä¢ Calculate trades carefully
  ‚Ä¢ Look 3-4 moves ahead

**On Expert:**
  ‚Ä¢ Study opening theory
  ‚Ä¢ Avoid weaknesses in position
  ‚Ä¢ Create long-term plans
  ‚Ä¢ Endgame knowledge crucial
  ‚Ä¢ AI struggles with:
    - Long-term strategic plans
    - Sacrifices for initiative
    - Complex endgames

**General Tips:**
  ‚Ä¢ Take your time, don't rush
  ‚Ä¢ Check every move for tactics
  ‚Ä¢ Use the undo feature to learn!
  ‚Ä¢ Practice endgames (K+P vs K, etc.)
